# Mark Twain, Vampire Hunter: The Game

### PRE-ALPHA

Hello! MTVH: The Game will mainly be a text adventure. You will choose whether
you want to be Mark Twain or Abraham Lincoln, and a map will then be displayed
with a number of locations on it. When you click a location, it will either go
into another map, or start a text adventure in that location. Here is a plan of
what the map might look like:

And in text adventure mode, it'll look something like this:

There is an egg on the table.

[[Throw the egg out the window](#)]

[[Eat the egg](#)]

[[Drill through the table](#)]

[[Attack the wall](#)]

You throw the egg out the window! It just so happens to hit the Taylor Swift
vampire! You destroyed Taylor Swift!

etc.

And here are some icons we can use:
